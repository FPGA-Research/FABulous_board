# FABulous board

The PCB created here is used for an eFPGA created using the [FABulous Framework](https://github.com/FPGA-Research-Manchester/FABulous]).
It is based on the [hardware files of the caravel board repo](https://github.com/efabless/caravel_board/tree/main/hardware) (commit `1f99718c0766020aeabb0c0db4c8623b71fb3e77`).
The WCSP version is used since the available chips use this package.
